# CourseLinkScrape
Helps download course content from CourseLink with ease. (Experimental Project)  

This is the latest working part of this project  
It is able to log in and go through each subject in F19 SEM and click the download button in the table of contents  

To Update: make wait times dynamic -> rn it does compulsory waits which makes it a bit too slow  

## Disclaimer
  In no way does this program intend to harm and or overwhelm the website or it's server.  
  It's just an experimental project created to learn scraping from an actual big scale website  
  
  I will not hold responsibility if you choose to borrow and change any part of the code (especially the wait times!)
